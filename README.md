Vortex, Raspberry Pi and Grove Pi IoT Starter Kit examples

The Vortex IoT Starter Kit contains a ready-to-run example of how the Vortex OpenSplice implementation of Data Distribution Service (DDS) can easily be utilised to collect, share and make decisions on data in real time. The kit is comprised of a Grove Pi with several sensors directly connected to the I2C port of a Raspberry Pi 3. The Raspberry Pi hosts Vortex OpenSplice which uses this I2C port as an I/O to the Grove Pi, which in turn controls the sensors.  The kit also utilises Vortex Web is order to demonstrate the ease at which Web dashboards such as Freeboard can be used to visualise the data in a web browser.
