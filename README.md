Vortex, Raspberry Pi and Grove Pi IoT Starter Kit examples

The Vortex IoT Starter Kit contains a ready-to-go example of an end to end Data Distribution Service (DDS). It is comprised of a Grove Pi with several sensors directly connected to the I2C port of a Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi hosts Vortex Web and Vortex OpenSplice which use this I2C port as an I/O to the Grove Pi, which in turn controls the sensors.
